# Food Truck Finder Overview

This is a command line program for a user to find a food truck open at the time of running the application. The API used is sourced from the San Francisco governmentâ€™s website which has a public data source of food trucks here:

[SF Gov public data source for food trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b)

The user will see a list of 10 trucks open and prompted to see an additional 10 food trucks if they respond with a "y". Responding with an "n" will exit the program.
